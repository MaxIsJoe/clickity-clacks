# Clickity Clacks

An extension that plays sounds while typing for firefox, inspired by OperaGX.

## Notes:

- Due to how firefox/browser extensions are designed, audio cannot be played while typing inside the browser's search bar, new tab window, or any of firefox's own tabs (such as `about:debugging` and `about:preferences`).
- As of now, this does not include the ability to play background ambience like in OperaGX, it only plays sounds when you type.
